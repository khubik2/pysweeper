# BaryonSweeper - a JigKick internal service tool emulator

## How-to
You can watch the video or follow a text instruction below.

To restore your PSP, follow a simple instruction: 
1. Get neccessary hardware to make a probe: 
    - a USB to TTL converter;
    - a 1n4148 diode; 
    - a 10kOhm resistor (not required); 
    - a way to connect to battery contacts (anything from loose wires to connector from a sacrificial battery)
    - soldering equipment or breadboard with jumpers
2. Build your probe - one-wire UART (aka K-line) adapter. You can omit an external battery if you power your PSP with a DC charger. Be aware that adapter's power output alone is not sufficient to power the PSP. You can also omit 10kOhm diode.

3. Create a Magic Memory Stick compatible with PSP-3000. You need to use either an official JigKick MS clone or balika011's DDCv9 - you can create both with my tool (https://github.com/khubik2/JigKick-Media-Creator)
4. To start the emulator, install necessary pip packages: `pycryptodome`, `tk` and `pyserial`.
5. Insert your memory stick and connect your adapter to computer running the emulator, select the COM port of your adapter and start the service.
6. Connect your probe to PSP's battery terminals. If done right, it should take one or two seconds for PSP to enter recovery mode and boot from MS.
